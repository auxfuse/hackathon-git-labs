## About the ... Dev, Project, Scope. 🤔

Hey there! 👋 I'm Anthony (aka Auxfuse), a Frontend Developer and an avid open source hackathon enthusiast, especially those held by [Code Institute's Community](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/). I built this project as a structured approach to submitting your first, of hopefully many, Pull Requests to Open Source. To learn more about me and follow my other work, click here 👉 [Auxfuse](https://github.com/auxfuse). One small tidbit about me, is I love Emojis, they are so damn colorful and can really help to spice up a wall of text. 📃

It's common knowledge that the inner workings to Git are often the initial stumbling blocks to most people making their first Pull Request (PR) to a project. It can be frustrating, confusing and just a bit of an undertaking trying to get to grips with it.

In the last 18 months or so, (2020/2021), Hackathons became a regular routine of mine. Not because it was code/programming, but because it was an avenue for me to challenge myself. Not just with my code, but with my Social Skills, working in a team environment, working alone on tasks in a sprint, and you guessed it.....Version Control (especially with a team!). 🔀

This is a fundamental competency that most don't realise along their Coding journey. Because learning can be somewhat of a solo, lonely undertaking. The need to learn Version Control in a team is not a priority. You might learn how to create a repo, add to the staging area, commit, and push to same....but you wouldn't (or might not) have the opportunity to do all those things all at the same time as a few team members, with code conflicts, branches, forks, merges. You can see that this is starting to grow legs. 😅

Take your time with this process. Rome wasn't built in a day... 🏛, (ugh, that term is a bit stale now 😂), and your competencies or skillsets won't either.

The steps outlined below will be IDE/Editor agnostic, but where possible this guide is centered towards guiding you to do particular tasks that should be global across many of the modern day IDEs/Editors.

There are two proposed streams to this project for the participant to throw their hands at, Basic and Intermediate. There is a plan in place to extend this to Advanced in the future.

### Project Streams

The [Basic](https://github.com/auxfuse/hackathon-git-labs/blob/main/basic.md) stream for this project will enable the user to learn & demonstrate:
- Minimum knowledge required to submit a PR
    - Forking the main repo
    - Setting the upstream from their Fork back to the main repo
    - Cloning the Forked project to their local development IDE/Editor
    - Creating a branch from within the IDE/Editor using the Command Line Interface
- Adding to a JSON file following a pre-defined format
- Commiting work to their branch
- Creating a PR
- Completing the PR template
- Engaging with the nominated maintainers of the repo via the PR threads
- Having their PRs approved/decline or merged into the project

The [Intermediate](https://github.com/auxfuse/hackathon-git-labs/blob/main/intermediate.md) stream for this project will enable the user to learn & demonstrate:
- HTML/CSS mini-creation which will be automatically linked to from the Landing Page.

    Sometimes, it's great to showcase your work in a directory like this. You never know who you might one day be sitting beside for work 🙂😀 So use this as an opportunity to create something bespoke and unique, showcasing your skills using HTML & CSS.

- Directory surfing and creating sub-directories
- Optional review and delve into the default files of the project where you will find Grid, Flexbox, Root variables, Fetch API, JSON etc. All of these are are done in vanilla languages, and this project is completely framework-LESS.

## Credits/Acknowledgements/Afterthoughts 💭

My formal accomplishments as a student are because of [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/)'s Curriculum, but more impactfully, to it's Community. Not only have I made some of the greatest friends, but I've gotten to work alongside so many of them in the Community Hackathons. If you think being a developer is something you are interested in, I would definitely endorse CI for their current curriculum and the community at large. Learning can be lonely, but it doesn't have to be. 🤜

Special Shoutout to these people 🙌:
- [Tim Nelson](https://github.com/TravelTimN) - My friend and a constant reflection of how the community is now thanks to his efforts as not only a Student, but as a Lead, Tutor, Assessor, Content Creator and now a Mentor.
- [Stefan Dworschak](https://github.com/stefdworschak) - My introduction to Open Source could of been very painless. But Stefan, ushered me through with incredible patience and a wealth of knowledge to boot. I owe my entire start to Open Source to him.
- [Jim Morel](https://github.com/JimLynx) - It's not a jeep! 😅 An inside joke between us both. Student, turned friend, and now the face of Code Institute's Community. The man behind Slackbot responses, and the lead program. Jim shows incredible attention to detail to the community, and it's a good thing too, as the community is quite possibly CI's biggest and greatest asset. 🤜

    Community leaders, people who have shown passion and ample knowledge to others in need. This team is a cornerstone to the Community Hackathons. From providing support, to initiative and collaboration of their own to help the community flourish.
