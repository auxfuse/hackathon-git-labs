## About the ... Dev, Project, Scope. 🤔

Hey there! 👋 I'm Anthony (aka Auxfuse), a Frontend Developer and an avid open-source hackathon enthusiast, especially those held by [Code Institute's Community](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/). I built this project as a structured approach to submitting your first, of hopefully many, Pull Requests to Open Source. To learn more about me and follow my other work, click here 👉 [Auxfuse](https://github.com/auxfuse). One small tidbit about me, I love Emojis, they are so damn colorful and can help to spice up a wall of text. 📃

It's common knowledge that the inner workings of Git are often the initial stumbling blocks to most people making their first Pull Request (PR) to a project. It can be frustrating, confusing, and just a bit of an undertaking trying to get to grips with it.

In the last 18 months or so, (2020/2021), Hackathons became a routine of mine. Not because it was code/programming, but because it was an avenue for me to challenge myself. Not just with my code, but with my Social Skills, working in a team environment, working alone on tasks in a sprint, and you guessed it.....Version Control (especially with a team!). 🔀

This is a fundamental competency that most don't realize along their Coding journey. Because learning can be somewhat of a solo, lonely undertaking. The need to learn Version Control in a team is not a priority. You might learn how to create a repo, add to the staging area, commit, and push to the same....but you wouldn't (or might not) have the opportunity to do all those things all at the same time as a few team members, with code conflicts, branches, forks, merges. You can see that this is starting to grow legs. 😅

## Important notice about Hacktoberfest 2022

🎃🌐💻

This project is all about Open Source and learning how to submit your first Pull Requests. As it is now Hacktoberfest (today is 01/10/2022), we are now accepting Pull Requests that meet the `intermediate.md` specification. That is, a fully custom directory added to the Community utilizing HTML, CSS & JS, and of course with your details added to the `data/community.json` file!

Please still use the `basic.md` guide! It would be great to get your first Pull Request using that guide, and then to see you come back to the `intermediate.md` guide adding your own custom creations to this platform! We can then review your PR, approve it, and merge it. And if you manage to submit 4 accepting PRs in the month of Hacktoberfest to repos with the Hacktoberfest topic, you can grab yourself some neat swag! Check it out here: [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)

Take your time with this process. Rome wasn't built in a day... 🏛, (ugh, that term is a bit stale now 😂), and your competencies or skillsets won't either.

The steps outlined below will be IDE/Editor agnostic, but where possible this guide is centered on guiding you to do particular tasks that should be global across many of the modern-day IDEs/Editors.

There are two proposed streams to this project for the participant to throw their hands at, Basic and Intermediate. There is a plan in place to extend this to Advanced in the future.

### Project Streams 👇👇

Pick from the below to start your PR journey:

The [Basic](basic.md) stream for this project will enable the user to learn & demonstrate:

- Minimum knowledge required to submit a PR
  - Forking the main repo
  - Setting the upstream from their Fork back to the main repo
  - Cloning the Forked project to their local development IDE/Editor
  - Creating a branch from within the IDE/Editor using the Command Line Interface
- Adding to a JSON file following a pre-defined format

  **_Any PR that only satisfies this guide will not be Hacktoberfest approved and valid. For Hacktoberfest submissions, please utilize the `intermediate.md` guide._**

- Committing work to their branch
- Creating a PR
- Completing the PR template
- Engaging with the nominated maintainers of the repo via the PR threads
- Having their PRs approved/declined or merged into the project

The [Intermediate](intermediate.md) stream for this project will enable the user to learn & demonstrate:

- HTML/CSS mini-creation which will be automatically linked to the Landing Page.

  Sometimes, it's great to showcase your work in a directory like this. You never know who you might one day be sitting beside for work 🙂😀 So use this as an opportunity to create something bespoke and unique, showcasing your skills using HTML & CSS.

  **_Any PR that satisfies this guide will be Hacktoberfest approved and valid 👏👏_**

- Directory surfing and creating sub-directories
- Optional review and delve into the default files of the project where you will find Grid, Flexbox, Root variables, Fetch API, JSON, etc. All of these are being done in vanilla languages, and this project is completely framework-LESS.

## Credits/Acknowledgements/Afterthoughts 💭

My formal accomplishments as a student are because of [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/)'s Curriculum, but more impactfully, to its Community. Not only have I made some of the greatest friends, but I've gotten to work alongside so many of them in the Community Hackathons. If you think being a developer is something you are interested in, I would endorse CI for their current curriculum and the community at large. Learning can be lonely, but it doesn't have to be. 🤜

Special Shoutout to these people 🙌:

- [Tim Nelson](https://github.com/TravelTimN) - My friend and a constant reflection of how the community is now thanks to his efforts as not only a Student but as a Lead, Tutor, Assessor, Content Creator, and now a Mentor.
- [Stefan Dworschak](https://github.com/stefdworschak) - My introduction to Open Source could have been very painless. But Stefan ushered me through with incredible patience and a wealth of knowledge to boot. I owe my entire start to Open Source to him.
- [Jim Morel](https://github.com/JimLynx) - It's not a jeep! 😅 An inside joke between us both. The student who turned friend, and now the face of Code Institute's Community. The man behind Slackbot responses, and the lead program. Jim shows incredible attention to detail to the community, and it's a good thing too, as the community is quite possibly CI's biggest and greatest asset. 🤜
- The Hackathon Team Leads:

  - [Naoise Gaffney](https://github.com/NaoiseGaffney)
  - [Aideen Malone](https://github.com/AideenM12)
  - [Gwen Bradbury](https://github.com/Gwen-Bradbury)
  - [Andrew Dempsey](https://github.com/andrewdempsey2018)
  - [Alissa Troiano](https://github.com/alissatroiano)

  Community leaders are people who have shown passion and ample knowledge to others in need. This team is a cornerstone of the Community Hackathons. From providing support, to initiative and collaboration of their own to help the community flourish.
