                    This guide is intended for those who want to create a PR with some unique content associated with

                    Maybe you've done a PR before with a Hackathon team and need a refresher? Or you have just completed
                    the
                    <a href="#">basic.md</a> portion of this Community Guide Project, and now want to do another PR with
                    a
                    custom developed HTML & CSS Creation?
                </p>

                <p>Then dive in below! This can be your first, or maybe your second...or even your third PR. Don't be
                    afraid
                    to
                    submit a few different JSON objects, and then sub-directories to boot. ü§ú

                    This project is made for you, the Participant, but over time most of the work in this project will
                    be

                                    expansive works of art, the reality is we will still be doing Code Reviews and the

                            dataset, created a sub-directory, and done some coding too. We do all of this so that the
                            default project structure is left un-mutated and that you are automatically added to the
                            root <span>index.html</span> file Community section.</p>
                        <p>This is a fun way to meet new developers who you may one day be coding alongside of in a
                            team, or asking them for help with a query in the Slack CI community, so please take a look
                            at some of the other creations! And check back often to see all the new ones as they come
